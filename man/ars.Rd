\title{Adaptive Rejection Sampling}
\usage{
ars(f, N, x0 = c(-1.0, 1.0), bounds = c(-Inf, Inf), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{function from which to sample (must be log-concave)}

\item{N}{number of observations desired}

\item{x0}{vector of initial x points used to approximate h=log(f(x))}

\item{bounds}{vector (length 2) of lower and upper bounds for the distribution function f}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to f}
}
\value{
returns (length N) vector of samples from the density function f(x)
}
\description{
\code{ars} returns a sample of length N from the density function f
}
\details{
Adaptive Rejection Sampling algorithm for sampling from any univariate log-concave density function f(x).
This algorithm is particularly useful in situations where computing f(x) may be expensive, as
the number of times f(x) must be sampled scales approximately 3N^{1/3}, where N
is the total number of samples, which is significantly more efficient
than conventional rejection sampling.  Also, f(x) is not required to be normalized.

IMPORTANT: x0 must satisfy the following conditions:

At least one of dh(x0)/dx must be positive or the left bound must not be -Inf

AND

At least one of dh(x0)/dx must be negative or the right bound must not be Inf.
}
\examples{
N <- 10000
x <- ars(dnorm, N)
x <- ars(dexp, N, x0=c(1.0), bounds=c(0.0, Inf))
x <- ars(dgamma, N, x0=c(2.5), bounds=c(0.0, Inf), shape=3.0, rate=2.0)
## Could use hist to visualize distribution, e.g.
## hist(x, breaks = 50, freq=FALSE)

The following will produce an error
\dontrun{
x <- ars(dgamma, N, x0=c(0.1), bounds=c(0.0, Inf), shape=3.0, rate=2.0)
}
